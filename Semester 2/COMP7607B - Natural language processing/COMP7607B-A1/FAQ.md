**1. What is Word2Vec?**

Word2Vec is a technique and a set of models used to produce **word embeddings**. These embeddings are distributed numerical representations of words, where words with similar meanings are located closer together in a vector space. It's a way to capture the semantic relationships between words based on their context in a large corpus of text.

**2. What are word embeddings?**

Word embeddings are vectors that represent words in a multi-dimensional space. Each dimension captures a different aspect of the word's meaning. The closer two word vectors are in this space, the more semantically similar the words are considered to be.

**3. How does Word2Vec work?**

Word2Vec uses a shallow neural network (typically with one hidden layer) to learn word embeddings. It comes in two main architectures:

*   **Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW):** Predicts a target word based on its surrounding context words.
*   **Skip-gram:** Predicts the surrounding context words given a target word.

Both models learn by iterating through a large text corpus and adjusting the word vectors based on the prediction errors.

**4. What is the difference between CBOW and Skip-gram?**

*   **CBOW:** Faster to train, slightly better accuracy for frequent words.
*   **Skip-gram:** Works well with small amounts of training data, represents rare words or phrases well.

**5. What are the benefits of using Word2Vec?**

*   **Captures Semantic Relationships:** Word2Vec embeddings capture semantic relationships like synonymy, antonymy, and analogy (e.g., "king" - "man" + "woman" â‰ˆ "queen").
*   **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reduces the high dimensionality of one-hot encoded words to a lower-dimensional, dense vector space.
*   **Improved Performance in NLP Tasks:** Word embeddings significantly improve the performance of various NLP tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question answering.
*   **Transfer Learning:** Pre-trained Word2Vec models can be used as a starting point for other NLP tasks, saving time and resources.

**6. What are the limitations of Word2Vec?**

*   **Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) Words:** Word2Vec cannot handle words that were not present in the training corpus.
*   **Context Window Limitation:** The context window used during training is limited, so it might not capture long-range dependencies.
*   **Polysemy:** Word2Vec assigns a single vector to each word, which can be problematic for words with multiple meanings (polysemy).
*   **Bias:** Word2Vec models can inherit biases present in the training data, leading to potentially unfair or discriminatory outcomes.

**7. What are some common applications of Word2Vec?**

*   **Text Classification:** Categorizing text documents into predefined classes.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in a text.
*   **Machine Translation:** Translating text from one language to another.
*   **Question Answering:** Answering questions based on a given text.
*   **Recommendation Systems:** Recommending items based on user preferences and item similarities.
*   **Information Retrieval:** Finding relevant documents based on a query.

**8. How can I use Word2Vec?**

You can use Word2Vec in several ways:

*   **Train your own model:** Use libraries like Gensim (Python) to train a Word2Vec model on your own corpus.
*   **Use pre-trained models:** Download pre-trained models from sources like Google (Google News dataset) or use models available in libraries like Gensim and spaCy.
*   **Fine-tune pre-trained models:** Adapt a pre-trained model to your specific task by further training it on your data.

**9. What are some popular libraries for using Word2Vec?**

*   **Gensim (Python):** A popular library for topic modeling and word embeddings, including Word2Vec.
*   **TensorFlow (Python):** A deep learning framework that can be used to implement Word2Vec.
*   **PyTorch (Python):** Another popular deep learning framework that can be used for Word2Vec.
*   **spaCy (Python):** An NLP library that provides pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings.

**10. What are some alternatives to Word2Vec?**

*   **GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation):** Another popular word embedding technique that uses a different approach based on word co-occurrence statistics.
*   **FastText:** An extension of Word2Vec that considers subword information, allowing it to handle OOV words and rare words better.
*   **ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models):** Contextualized word embeddings that capture different meanings of a word based on its context.
*   **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):** A powerful language model that produces highly contextualized word embeddings.

**11. How can I evaluate the quality of Word2Vec embeddings?**

*   **Intrinsic Evaluation:**
    *   **Word Analogy Task:** Assessing the ability of the model to solve analogies (e.g., "man" is to "woman" as "king" is to "queen").
    *   **Word Similarity Task:** Comparing the similarity scores assigned by the model to human judgments of word similarity.
*   **Extrinsic Evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of the embeddings on downstream NLP tasks like text classification or sentiment analysis.

**12. What is negative sampling and why is it used?**

Negative sampling is a technique used to improve the efficiency of training Word2Vec, especially the Skip-gram model. Instead of updating all the output weights for each training sample, it only updates the weights for the correct context word and a small number of randomly selected "negative" words (words that are not in the context). This significantly reduces the computational cost.

**13. What is hierarchical softmax and how does it differ from negative sampling?**

Hierarchical softmax is another technique for improving training efficiency. It uses a binary tree to represent the output layer, where each word is a leaf node. Instead of calculating the probability for all words, it only needs to calculate the probabilities along the path from the root to the target word. While it can be more accurate than negative sampling in some cases, it is generally slower, especially for large vocabularies.

**14. How can I visualize Word2Vec embeddings?**

Techniques like t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings to 2D or 3D for visualization. This allows you to see the relationships between words in a visual way.
