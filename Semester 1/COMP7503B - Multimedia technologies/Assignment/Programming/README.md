# Preamble:

This assignment is composed of two parts: a) Programming Part, and b) Written Part.
The purpose of this assignment is to get you familiar with the concepts of multimedia
systems, through the realization of Smart City Use Case(s). In essence, you are required to
acquire appropriate data streams from https://data.gov.hk/, and based on these data to craft
up use cases and derive insights in relation to smart city initiatives. There is no fixed scope
nor limit for the smart city use cases, you are free to choose appropriate use cases as you see
fit.

The programming part requires you to implement an application that fetch data streams from
https://data.gov.hk/, data analysis and correlation, as well as dashboards to present insights
in relation to your selected smart city use cases. The written part, on the other hand, requires
you to write a report, in which you explain in details your smart city use cases, and
corresponding implementation details.
