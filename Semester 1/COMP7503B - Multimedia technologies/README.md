## Assignment 1B

### Preamble:

In this assignment, you are required to analyze phoneme patterns based on spectral analysis technique. In order to perform spectral analysis, you can do so based on the following mobile apps on Android/iOS platform.

### Questions:

1. Launch the app on your mobile device in a quiet environment, speak the sentence “Peter buttered the burnt toast”. Take the screenshot of the spectrogram, and indicate the presence of the stop consonants and voiced phonemes in the spectrogram.

2. Repeat question 1 but this time with the sentence changed to “I owe you a Yo-Yo”.

3. To implement speech to text algorithm, it is important to do word segmentation during spectrogram analysis. From what you observed in question 1 & 2, explain why it is not easy to do word segmentation based on silence detection.

4. Explain, by way of illustrating a number of sample spectrograms, why it is necessary to use phonetic alphabet (i.e., A - Alpha, B - Beta, C - Charlie, …) to ensure correct exchange of letters over voice messages by radio or telephone.
